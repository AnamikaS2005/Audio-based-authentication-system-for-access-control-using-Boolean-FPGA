Audio-Based Authentication System for Access Control using Boolean FPGA

This project implements a secure, touchless access control system using voice-based authentication on a Boolean FPGA (Spartan-6). It combines Python-generated audio and Verilog-based FPGA design to analyze and compare dominant audio frequencies, allowing access only when the voice patterns match.

ðŸš€ Project Overview

    Technology: Spartan-6 FPGA (Boolean Board), Verilog HDL, Python (gTTS, pydub), Vivado Design Suite
    
    Function: Uses FFT-based frequency analysis to compare a test voice against a stored reference and activates a servo motor if they match (simulates door unlock).

Applications: Smart home access, secure labs, voice-based authentication systems

ðŸŽ¯ System Workflow

Audio Generation (Python):

    Generates speech using Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS)
    
    Converts audio to 16-bit PCM and saves as .mem format

Data Transfer (Python UART):

    Sends chunks via serial to FPGA
    
    Commands: 'R' (Reference), 'T' (Test), 'D' (Display/Compare)

FPGA Processing (Verilog):

    Stores .mem data into BRAM
    
    Simulates FFT by finding peak amplitude
    
    Compares frequencies with 5% error margin
    
    Controls LED and Servo PWM based on match/mismatch

Servo Behavior:

    Match: 90Â° (Unlocked) | All LEDs ON
    
    Mismatch: 0Â° (Locked) | All LEDs OFF
